# `@thadrin/eu`

Eu is a Discord/Revolt Client Framework for Thaldrin

## examples

examples for how to use it are in [examples/](/examples)
the examples use `wavy` for imports, so you'll need to install it as well.

# support

There is no Documentation, other than typings, for this Project.

Because Eu is a Thaldrin internal project, I will, for now, also not provide support if you do decide to use it in your projects.
